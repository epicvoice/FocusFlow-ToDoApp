## ✨ Features (HTML structure & planned JS functionality)

# Current UI (HTML & CSS)
The static interface already includes:
- **Delete All** — a top-level button for clearing the entire task list.
- **New Task Title input + Add button** — UI for adding new tasks.
- **Search Task input** — intended for real-time task filtering.
- **Total Tasks display** — showing the number of tasks.
- **Task items layout** with:
  - a checkmark box on the left (for marking tasks as done),
  - a delete icon on the right (for removing a single task).
