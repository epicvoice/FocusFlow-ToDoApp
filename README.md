I’m currently exploring the world of frontend development and diving into building interactive web applications. This project is part of my journey to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. I’m experimenting with creating dynamic interfaces, handling user interactions, and gradually adding more advanced features like task filtering, categories (and eventually persistent storage) with vanilla JS, while improving my understanding of the frontend ecosystem.

--------------------------------------------------------------

## FEATURES (fully functional)
- Add New Tasks - via input and add button (also supports Enter).
- Delete All Tasks - clear the entire task list with one click.
- Mark Tasks as Completed - toggle the checkmark and optionally style completed tasks.
- Delete a Single Task using the 'x' icon on each task.
- Total Tasks Display count shows the current number of tasks.
- Task Layout: checkmark on the left, task text in the middle, delete icon on the right.
- Basic Error Handling which prevents adding empty tasks.

--------------------------------------------------------------
  
#  Planned JavaScript Functionality
The following JS features will be added soon:

##  Search Tasks
- Real-time filtering based on typed text.
- Highlight or hide tasks that don’t match the query.
## Choose among Categories 
- Select a category to which new task must be assigned (work, study etc.)
- Different colors for each category
## Local Storage Support
- Tasks will be saved after page reload.
- Store completed status, titles, and the entire list.
